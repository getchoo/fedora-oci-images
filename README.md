# fedora-oci-images

my custom oci images, but as close to upstream as possible. if you want something more usable ootb, you're probably looking for [ublue](https://github.com/ublue-os)

i probably won't be using this until sigstore's [keyless signatures](https://docs.sigstore.dev/signing/overview/) from a workflow are [supported](https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/issues/4272#issuecomment-1689160021) by rpm-ostree/spokeo
